# DSB-AdmissionChallenge
Data Science Bootcamp Application - Admissions Challenge


## Settings:

First need to make a database.

We are gonna use a mysql (it's a requeriment to use mysql).


To save some memory and make it more modern we are gonna use a docker conteiner, follow it's the instuctions:
(need to know the basic of docker to folloew this tutorial)

Open the terminal and follow the commands:

### Creating a mysql database:
```
    docker run --name mysqlTest 
        -p 3306:3306 
        -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysqlPW 
        -e MYSQL_DATABASE=mysqlDB 
        -e MYSQL_USER=mysqlUser 
        -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=mysqlPassword 
        -d mysql: 8.0.31
```

> (version 8.0.31 is a request from the challenge)

to connect to the database (I'm using the Dbeaver's client ):

``` 
    jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mysqlDB?allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true&useSSL=false
```

Credentials:

```
    MYSQL_USER=mysqlUser 
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=mysqlPassword 
```

## Part 01 - Preliminary analysis in SQL :


> Notes: Keep in mind the data is not completely clean and it is possible that you will have to make assumptions on what data to ignore and why. Be sure to address these decisions and assumptions in your report.

>Three key variables to pay attention to in your analysis are: Campaign goals in dollars, Number of backers, and Length of campaigns

I'm adding a new column in the currency's table, the ratio to USD dollar, so it's able to normalize the values in USD dollar.

ID | Coin  | Ratio_to_dollar
-- | ----- | ---
1 | GBP   | 1.22
2 | USD   | 1
3 | CAD   | 0.79
4 | AUD   | 0.71
5 | NOK   | 0.10
6 | EUR   | 0.92
7 | MXN   | 20.37
8 | SEK   | 0.10
9 | NZD   | 0.65
10 | CHF   | 0.99
11 | DKK   | 0.14
12 | HKD   | 7.84
13 | SGD   | 0.74
14 | JPY   | 0.0093

### Questions to be answered
---
1. Are the goals for dollars raised significantly different between campaigns that are successful and unsuccessful?

- Defining 3 types of campaigns: **Successful**, **Failed** and **Undefined**. 

To ensure the reliability of our analysis, we need to normalize the results in USD and then add the comparative to predicted values per backer:


| | UNITS | AVERAGE GOAL | AVERAGE PLEDGED |SUM PLEDGED | BACKERS   | SUM PLEDGED / BACKER |
| ---------- | ----- | --------- | ------- |------------- | --------  | --------- |
| Successful | 5,319 | $10,151   | $22,948 | $11,717,920  | 1,500,730 | $81.34    |
| Failed     | 7,850 | $97,296   | $1,493  | $122,062,216 | 139,114   | $84.23     |
| Undefined   | 1,831 | $144,821  | $2,410  | $4,413,122   | 36,844    | $119.78    |
| All        | 15,000 | $72,195  | $9,213  | $138,193,258 | 1,676,688 | $82.42     |
 
<dl>
    <dt>Overview:</dt>
    <dt>- Successful campaigns</dt>

- The average pledge per backer for successful campaigns is $81.34, while the average pledge per backer for failed campaigns is $84.23. This suggests that the amount of money that people are willing to pledge to Kickstarter campaigns is not significantly affected by whether the campaign is successful or failed.

- The average goal for successful campaigns is $10,151, while the average goal for failed campaigns is $97,296. This suggests that successful campaigns are more likely to have realistic goals, while failed campaigns are more likely to have ambitious goals that are difficult to achieve.

- Successful campaigns tend to have lower average goals and higher average pledges than failed campaigns. This is likely because successful campaigns are more likely to be well-planned and well-executed, and they are more likely to have a strong community of backers who are willing to pledge more money.

- The average pledge for successful campaigns is $22,948, while the average pledge for failed campaigns is $1,493. This suggests that successful campaigns are more likely to attract a large number of backers who are willing to pledge a significant amount of money.
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>- Undefined campaigns</dt>

- The average pledge per backer is relatively consistent across all three categories. This suggests that the amount of money that people are willing to pledge to Kickstarter campaigns is not significantly affected by whether the campaign is successful, failed, or undefined.

- The average pledge per backer is higher for undefined campaigns than for successful or failed campaigns. This is likely because undefined campaigns are more likely to be ambitious and to have larger goals, which means that they need to attract more backers in order to be successful.

8. Do longer, or shorter campaigns tend to raise more money? Why?

- Determining that a short campaigns is 30 days, medium is 31 to 60 days and a long campaign is 61-100 we got this results:

## Part 2 - Visualize the Data:

The executives have asked you to create 5 data visualizations that illustrate the key insights, trends, patterns, and oddities in the data.

Your visualizations must include titles and labels, and a summary of why each visualization might be important for your client and/or relevant to solving their business problem. You can use any visualization tool of your choice to create these 5 visualizations (Excel, Google Sheets etc.)

5 visualizations
    titles 
    labels
    summary

---
---
## Part 3 - Findings & Recommendations :

Based on Parts 1 and 2, write a 2-4 page business recommendation report to the company’s executive board that answers the 3 key questions outlined in the business challenge:

- What is a realistic Kickstarter campaign goal (in dollars) should the company aim to raise?
- How many backers will be needed to meet their goal?
- How many backers can the company realistically expect, based on trends in their category?
Your report must include:

- An introduction outlining the business problem at hand
- A description of the analytical process you went through (based on your work on Parts 1 and 2). The goal here is to understand your thought process, and any assumptions you may have made.
- The 5 data visualizations you created in Part 2
- Your final business recommendation for the 3 business questions. Your recommendations must be data-driven, specific, and actionable.

Note: The report should be written for a non-technical, executive audience, should address each of the report requirements below, and ultimately, should emphasize how and why your data-driven recommendations will contribute to the success of this next Kickstarter campaign.

---
---
## Submission Format :

Please submit your Admissions Challenge as a zipped folder with the following items:

Your 2-4 page business report as a PDF
One .sql script with the full, working queries you performed (zipped file)
A maximum of 3 supplementary file types you’ve used in your visualization or analysis.
Note: If you are using Excel for your visuals or working files, please combine each of your working files together as separate tabs in a single Excel workbook.
